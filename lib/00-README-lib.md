# README - lib

Creaated: Wed 13 June 2018, Tim Telcik

## Overview

This lib folder contains Maven dependencies used by the PDF Publishing Tools project.

Some of the library files (jar) are currently available and valid in Maven Central, while others are missing or invalid.

JAR files missing from Maven central:

 * jodconverter-core-3.0-beta-4.jar
 * iText-toolbox-2.1.7.jar


JAR files available in Maven central:

 * ridl-3.0.1.jar

For now, the lib folder is a legacy of the Apache Ant build process and also a placeholder for the missing JAr files.
